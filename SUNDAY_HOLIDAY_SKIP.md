# 🎉 Sunday & Holiday Skip Feature

## ✅ Implementation Complete

The absent marking system now **automatically skips Sundays and holidays** before marking employees as absent.

---

## 🔍 How It Works

### **Before Marking Absent, System Checks:**

1. **Is it Sunday?** → Skip absent marking
2. **Is it a Holiday?** (from Holiday table) → Skip absent marking
3. **Is it past 1:00 PM IST?** → Continue
4. **Mark absent** employees who haven't checked in

---

## 📊 Logic Flow

```
Task runs at 1:20 PM IST
    ↓
Check: Is today Sunday?
    ├─ YES → Skip (no marking)
    └─ NO → Continue
    ↓
Check: Is today a holiday?
    ├─ YES → Skip (no marking)
    └─ NO → Continue
    ↓
Check: Is it past 1:00 PM?
    ├─ NO → Skip (too early)
    └─ YES → Mark absent employees
```

## 🧪 Test Examples

### **Test 1: Sunday**
```bash
python manage.py mark_absent
```

**Output:**
```
Running absent marking task at 2025-01-26 13:20:00+05:30
Date: 2025-01-26 (Sunday)
🎉 Today is Sunday - No absent marking needed!
```

### **Test 2: Holiday (e.g., Republic Day)**
```bash
python manage.py mark_absent
```

**Output:**
```
Running absent marking task at 2025-01-26 13:20:00+05:30
Date: 2025-01-26 (Sunday)
🎉 Today is a holiday: Republic Day - No absent marking needed!
```

### **Test 3: Regular Working Day**
```bash
python manage.py mark_absent
```

**Output:**
```
Running absent marking task at 2025-01-27 13:20:00+05:30
Date: 2025-01-27 (Monday)
👥 Total employees to check: 10
------------------------------------------------------------
  ❌ NEW ABSENT: John Doe (john@example.com)
------------------------------------------------------------
✅ Task completed!
   • Newly marked absent: 1
```

## 📅 Holiday Table Integration

The system checks the **Holiday** model for holidays:

**Holiday Model Fields:**
- `name` - Holiday name (e.g., "Republic Day")
- `date` - Holiday date
- `type` - Holiday type
- `country` - Country (default: "India")
- `weekday` - Auto-calculated weekday

**Example Holiday Record:**
```python
Holiday.objects.create(
    name="Republic Day",
    date="2025-01-26",
    type="National Holiday",
    country="India",
    year=2025,
    month=1
)
```

## 🔧 Updated Files

### **1. Scheduler** (`accounts/scheduler.py`)
- ✅ Checks Sunday (weekday == 6)
- ✅ Checks Holiday table
- ✅ Logs skip reason

### **2. Management Command** (`accounts/management/commands/mark_absent.py`)
- ✅ Checks Sunday
- ✅ Checks Holiday table
- ✅ Shows skip message

### **3. API View** (`accounts/views.py`)
- ✅ API endpoint: `POST /api/accounts/mark_absent/`
- ✅ Returns JSON with skip reason

## ✅ Benefits

1. **No Manual Intervention** - Automatically skips non-working days
2. **Holiday Table Driven** - Add holidays to Holiday table, system respects them
3. **Consistent Across All Methods** - API, Management Command, and Scheduler all skip

---

## 🎯 Current Schedule

- **Time**: 1:20 PM IST daily
- **Skips**: Sundays + Holidays
- **Marks**: Monday - Saturday (working days only)

## 🔄 To Add a Holiday

```python
from accounts.models import Holiday

Holiday.objects.create(
    name="Independence Day",
    date="2025-08-15",
    type="National Holiday",
    country="India",
    year=2025,
    month=8
)
```

The system will automatically skip this date! 🎉

---

**All three methods (Scheduler, Management Command, API) now respect Sundays and Holidays!** ✅
